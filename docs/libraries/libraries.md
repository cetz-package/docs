CeTZ provides more specialised and focused functions in order to draw plots, charts, angles etc. They have been separated from the `draw` module into separate libraries for the sake of organisation and clarity. 

We are planning to move them into their own packages. We don't know when but most likely once the current Typst package handling system gets improved.
